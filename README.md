Decentralized version control!

You can build a little repository on your own computer to store files. 

You make a copy on your repository! 

Commiting is keeping track of a significant milestone. 

Github has a server - which is a fancy word for a computer to store stuff lol

Servers SERVE FILES - talking to a computer that connects to a network. 

Only your computer can see commits. To put it on the server, you have to PUSH

Someone has to clone it before they can pull it

Conflicts can happen if two people change the same file
